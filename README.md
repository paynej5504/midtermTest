This program uses JavaScript and handlebar files to show you a cute picture of a hamster.

Installation

Requires the use of Node. To install run: npm install node.
Require the use of Express. To install run: npm install express.
(Note: installing node also installs a node_module package. The .gitignore file
tells the repository to ignore this.)
Requires the use of handlebars. To install run: npm install express-handlebars.

Running the script
To run the script you will have to run it in GitBash or any other terminal by typing
“node *where your file is located/name of file*” or if you open Git Bash in the folder it would be 
"node app.js".
Then it will open up in localhost:3000.
